# .NET Core Angular w/Dev Container

Taking advantage of the remote container development environment integration for VSCode, this is a quick template for a starting point.

> Theoretically, all this needs is to be copied/forked, renamed, re-opened in a VSCode container (generated from the .Dockerfile in the .devcontainer folder largely), and will immediately function as a .NET Core 6.0 LTS WebApi and Angular development environment.  None of the related SDK artifacts need be installed on the development machine, yet they will all be there in development through the integrated terminal session into the running development container.  Nifty.
